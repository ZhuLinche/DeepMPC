Linear Complementarity Problem solver which implements lexicographic Lemke's algorithm. 


INSTALLATION:
To install the package within Matlab, just add the path to the main folder "lcp". 
In case that you want to recompile the source code, go to the "lcp" directory and type 
"lcp_compile" at the Matlab prompt.

FEATURES:
 - The algorithm avoids cycling and degeneracy problems via lexicographic 
   perturbation technique.
 - Solid linear algebra - based on BLAS and LAPACK 
                        - recursive basis update based on LUMOD package
 - Robust features - automatic data scaling
                   - repetitive basis refactorization
 - Tailored to Matlab & Simulink specifications and Real-Time Workshop.


USAGE:
For a demonstration how to use the code, type "lcp_test" for a simple example.
